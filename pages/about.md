# About Me

[Home](/)

I am an engineer, a problem solver. I love learning new technologies
and implementing. That said I have gotten my chance to work on many
legacy environments as well. 

I have started thinking about and working on 
[my personnel values](values.md)
and have refined them down to:

* Do the Right Thing
* Value People
* Continuous Incremental Improvement

## Career

A few fun highlights from career:

* my first job out of college had 2 projects: implementing a multi-site network with VPN and building a company intranet
* next job was rewriting a control system in Visual Basic using GPIB and RS-485 controllers
* After that network management for Ship-to-Shore network connections
* fast forward to my latest adventure in getting to take a deep dive into AWS and microservices at scale

## Personally

Personally, I enjoy being outdoors and working with my hands. 
I love to take our RV to state parks and enjoy a nature hike.
I also love seeing something built, there is nothing like feeling
of a completed project.
