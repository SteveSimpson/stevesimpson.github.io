# My Values

## Do the Right Thing

This is probably the simplest sounding and the hardest to do. 
It can be making sure you pay for everything at the checkout.
It can be making sure that you call out others who deserve credit
that you have been given.
It definitely is letting go of your ego and listening to others.
It is apologizing and making things right when you screw up.
It can be confusing when you have competing priorities.

## Value People

Respect others.
Take the time to listen.
You can learn something from anybody.
Don't make hasty judgments.

## Continuous Incremental Improvement

This concept is to make very small changes / improvements / refinements
all the time.
At JumpCloud this was termed "1% Better Everyday", focused on individual growth.
With a few notable exceptions, I found this is the key to personal growth.
This is the core concept behind Agile development: make a change,
figure out what isn't quite right, repeat.
It works for software and people, but not so great for bridges.
