# My Values

## Value People

Respect others.
Take the time to listen.
You can learn something from anybody.
Don't make hasty judgments.

## 1% Better Everyday

Borrowing this from JumpCloud; I like it.
This concept is to make very small changes / improvements / refinements
all the time.
With a few notable exceptions, I found this is the key to personal growth.
This is the core concept behind Agile development: make a change,
figure out what isn't quite right, repeat.
It works for software and people, but not so great for bridges.

## Do What's Right

This is probably the simplest sounding and the hardest to do. 
It can be taking the extra time to give someone the attention they deserve.
It can be making sure that you call out others who deserve credit
that you have been given.
It definitely is letting go of your ego and listening to others.
It is apologizing and making things right when you say or do the wrong thing.
It can be confusing when you have competing priorities.
